# QUESTIONS

Open items needing a human. Task 4's gate has passed and is committed; none of
these block it.

---

## 1. Can a move at ≤ 0 charges actually be played? — one click settles it

**Status 2026-08-15: no longer blocking, but still unproven.** The flag
`chargesAreHardLimit` now defaults to `true` (prune) on the strength of the
enemy-only recount — 11 clean opportunities where the enemy held a move at ≤0,
0 taken, `p ≈ 0.012` under the soft-cost null. See SPEC §4 charges. The player's
own 12 opportunities are excluded as policy-contaminated: the user was following
a guide that avoided low-charge moves, so a zero there proves nothing about the
rule.

**What we still want.** `p ≈ 0.012` is suggestive, not settled, and it is the
single biggest claimed edge in §4a. One observation of an enemy playing a move
at ≤0 flips the default straight back.

**The decisive test costs no energy and takes one minute:** in the browser
client, play a single move until its charge counter reads `-1` (any move, any
run — the last-charge rule drives it there after two plays from 3), then try to
click that move. Report whether the client lets you select it.

- If it refuses → hard prune confirmed, remove the flag.
- If it accepts → soft cost confirmed, flip the default to `false` and we have
  been pruning a legal move.

Please do this before Task 5 if convenient; §4a's EV engine is built on it.

## 2. Loot table shape — RESOLVED 2026-08-14, superseded by question 5

`lootOptions`/`lootPhase` are not the reward surface at all; boons arrive via
`rewardPathPhase`/`rewardPathOptions[]` and the loot table rides on
`enemyPathOptions[].lootTable`. See SPEC §3d. What remains open is the tier
choice — question 5.

## 5. The coverage wall — boons are now modelled, and the wall did not move

**Updated 2026-08-15 (Task 4.5).** Item 1 below is **done**: boons are modelled
as verified state deltas (`src/sim/boons.ts`, SPEC §4d). It did not raise
`deepestScorableRoom`, which is still **1**. That is the finding, not a failure
of the attempt — and it changes what to ask for next.

Why it didn't move:

1. **No clean room-1 boon exists.** Both recorded room-1 offers are
   `AddLuck | CorrosiveShield | UpgradePaper` and
   `AddEvasion | AddTenacity | AddBlock`. All six are either unmodelled or grant
   a rolled stat whose damage effect is unexplained. `Heal` is the only clean
   boon in the corpus and it is only ever offered at **room 2**.
2. **Enemies 65 and 66 are unscorable innately** — nothing to do with boons. So
   a perfect boon model caps `deepestScorableRoom` at **2**.

The remaining work is capture. Three specific asks, in order of value per energy
spent. **All three fit inside a single watched run** (`scripts/watch.ts` already
records every state; none of these needs new tooling):

### 5a. Rolled-stat semantics — the highest-value capture

This is now the top blocker, ahead of everything else: it gates both the room-1
boons (`AddLuck`, `AddEvasion`) *and* enemy 65.

**What we have.** Counted in damage-taking opportunities: player `evasion 1`
8/9 exact, player `lck 1` 2/2, enemy `ev2+bl2+lk1` 6/7. The enemy-65 anomaly is
a Sword win that dealt exactly **8** of 16 — while the *same matchup against the
same enemy* dealt the full 16 elsewhere, so it is not a function of moves and
stats alone. SPEC §4e lists the hypotheses already tested and rejected.

**What would settle it.** ~30 exchanges where a side carries non-zero rolled
stats and actually takes damage. Concretely: take `AddEvasion` or `AddLuck`
early and play a long run, and/or fight enemy 65 through several Sword wins **at
full enemy armor** (the anomaly's one distinguishing feature).

### 5b. A clean room-1 boon offer

Even one recorded room-1 offer containing `Heal` — or any boon whose delta we
can verify and which grants no rolled stat — opens room 2 immediately. This is
pure luck of the draw, so it comes free with any watched run: just record what
gets offered at room 1 each time.

### 5c. One die-on-a-tie exchange

Cheap, and it resolves a confound that currently taints the only player-side
replay miss. At 037→038 the player took **0** from a 10-ATK tie. Either
`evasion 1` dodged, **or a side that dies on an exchange deals no damage** — and
that is the only exchange in the whole corpus where a side died on a *tie*, so
the two are indistinguishable. The second explanation needs no new mechanic and
would be a plain addition to the combat model.

**Capture:** finish any enemy off with a **tie** (mirror its move) rather than
an outright win, while the player is on non-zero armor, and record whether the
player takes damage.

### 5d. Burn — nearly closed, low priority

`amount` 3, flat 3 damage per exchange, non-decrementing over 3 exchanges
(SPEC §4f). Implemented behind a default-off flag. It stays off because the
boon val, the status amount and the damage are all `3`, and it is never seen
expiring. **Deliberately low priority:** the only burning enemy is in room 4,
which is unscorable for `ENEMY_BUFF` regardless, so resolving Burn alone buys no
coverage. Worth doing only once 5a lands.

## 6. `enemyPathOptions` tier choice — still unspecified

Safe / Risky / Dangerous, with an identical `lootTable` across all three tiers
in the single captured sample. If that generalises, higher tiers are pure added
risk and the rule is trivially "always Safe" — but it is one sample, and it is a
real strategic decision with no spec. One capture of a reward phase, reading all
three tiers' loot tables, settles it.

## 3. Fishing HAR — still blocks Task 7 (carried from session 01)

Confirmed this session that fishing is on a genuinely undiscovered surface:
**zero** matches for `/dendren|fish|cast|bait|node/i` across all seven probed
endpoints. There is nothing further to try without the capture.

Per SPEC §3a: gigaverse.io → DevTools → Network → filter Fetch/XHR → play one
Dendren cast start to finish → right-click → Save all as HAR →
`fixtures/fishing-cast.har` (already gitignored).

Not urgent — Tasks 4, 5 and 6 are all unblocked without it.

## 4. `dungeonId` in the action envelope — unverifiable until Task 6

The spec-drift diff flags `dungeonId` as quoted in SPEC.md but never seen in a
response. **This is not necessarily drift**: it is a *request* field in the §2
action envelope, and GET responses can neither confirm nor refute it.

Flagging it because the neighbouring evidence is suspicious — the API's own
`DUNGEON_ID_CID` means "run instance id", and the dungeon type is `ID_CID` as a
string. If `start_run` rejects `dungeonId: 5`, that naming is why. First real
POST at Task 6 settles it. Do not "fix" it speculatively before then.
